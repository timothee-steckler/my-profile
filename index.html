         <p> 
         I am a 1st year Master student at IESEG School of Management. I am doing my speciality in digital marketing because I am passionate about the world of advertising. I am also a photographer in my spare time and I am a great fan of skiing.

        <h2> Advertising ðŸ“°</h2>
        <p>
         I find the advertising business very interesting because it requires a lot of creativity and the work is different on each project. This is what I like today and what I aspire to do because understanding how a communication can target this or that type of person is one of my goals.

         <h2> Analogue Photography ðŸŽž</h2>
         <p>
         I'm passionate about photography, I've been immersed in it since I was a kid and I really like the mechanics of photography. I practice film photography because I find it more real than digital photography. Indeed, each photo is unique with film photography, they have noise, a history.

         <h2> Ski â›·ðŸŽ¿ðŸš¡ðŸš </h2>
         <p>
         Winter is my favorite season, I love the snow and I live in Switzerland close to the mountains. It is therefore logical that I am an avid skier. In December as well as in April, I can ski. For me, if there is a little snow, it is the occasion to take out the skis.
